## Project title

Do the Rats Run This City?: An Investigation into Prevalence of Rat
Sightings in New York City

## Project motivation

New York City is known for its rampant rat problem. Tourists and
resident alike shriek at the sight of rats in trash cans, rats in the
subway stations, rats on the sidewalk, rats in parks, rats in
restaurants, rats carrying pizza in their mouths, and the dreaded rat in
your apartment. But we want to know: are all boroughs and neighborhoods
created equal when it comes to these scurrying critters? Where are these
skittering vermin most likely to make their homes? Another dimension to
our project will involve the Rat Czar of New York City, a recently
appointed position created to manage the rat problem. Since assuming
office, has the Rat Czar made a difference in rat sightings? Also, we
want to explore if human density impacts rat density – for example, did
the COVID-19 pandemic impact rat sightings?

## Intended final products

- A webpage with a homepage, a page for statistical analysis, a page for
  a map, and a page for graphs and visualizations on the data
- A report describing how we completed the project
- A short screencast illustrating our project webpage

## Anticipated data sources

<https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe>

This data includes all the rat sightings reported to 311 from 2010 to
now (updated daily). Each incident includes the borough, location type,
the longitude and latitude, and more.

## Planned analyses/visualizations/coding challenges

- a map showing where rats are most densely populated
- a graph showing prevalence of rat sightings in the months before and
  after the Rat Czar office
- a regression analysis exploring which types of locations predict rat
  sightings
- a plot showing how rat sightings changed before, during, and after the
  COVID-19 pandemic

Challenges:

- Our chosen dataset is extremely large and contains data from the last
  13 years. We anticipate it will be difficult to parse through filter
  for the data we need.
- There are a lot of location types we couldn’t potentially use as a
  predictor for rat sightings, so it may be difficult to narrow them
  down to what might be most significant.

## Planned timeline

- Week of 11/13: Meet with teaching staff to discuss proposal, clean
  data

- Week of 11/20: Finishing tidying data and create visualizations/map

- Week of 11/27: Finish plotting and creating map/do regression
  analyses, start writing report

- Week of 12/4: Create website and implement the pages with
  visualizations, and regression analyses, record screencast, finish
  writing report
