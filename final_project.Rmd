## Interpretation of the Rat Density Map before Covid, March 2023 and November 2023
The bar graph above illustrates the rat density before Covid, March 2023 and November 2023 over the boroughs in New York City.
Between December, 2019 and March 2023, the graph shows significant difference in rat density especially in Manhattan. Between March and November 2023, the rat czar program was implemented on April 2023. These two graphs shows the comparison in density one month before the program started and the most recent density (as of November 2023). There are no significant change in density visible from the graph except it seems less dense in staten island.

## Interpretation of the Rat Density Map as of 2023
A graph showing the density change throughout the year of 2023.While some density change is visible through the graph, it is not significant enough to show major changes made by the rat czar program. The rat problem still seems severe through out the entire new york city. The density change maybe explained by other factors such as weather change and rats' breeding season.

# ANOVA test

## ANOVA test on location type:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
loc_df = 
  rats_df %>% 
    filter(year == "2018" | year == "2019" | year == "2020" | year == "2021" | year == "2022" | year == "2023") %>% 
    select(year, location_type) %>% 
    group_by(year, location_type) %>% 
    summarize(sightings = n()) %>% 
    arrange(desc(sightings)) %>% 
    filter(location_type == "3+ Family Apt. Building" | location_type == "1-2 Family Dwelling" | location_type == "Commercial Building" | location_type == "Construction Site")

loc_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = sightings, fill = location_type)) + 
  geom_area(aes(group = location_type, alpha = 0.8)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(title = "Rat sightings by location type 2018-2023")
```

## Interpretation of the ANOVA test on location type
From the chart, it's evident that the highest number of rat sightings occurred in 3+ Family Apt. Buildings (indicated by the purple area), which peaked around 2021. The second-highest number of sightings is in 1-2 Family Dwellings (indicated by the blue area), followed by Commercial Buildings (green), and the least number of sightings are at Construction Sites (yellow).

The alpha value is 0.8 refers to the significance level used in the ANOVA test. However, this is unusual because an alpha level of 0.8 would indicate a 20% probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (a high chance of a Type I error), whereas common alpha levels are 0.05 or 0.01, which correspond to a 5% or 1% risk, respectively. It's possible that the alpha level is actually 0.05 or 0.01, and the value 0.8 may represent the power of the test, which is the probability that the test correctly rejects a false null hypothesis.
