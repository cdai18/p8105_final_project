<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In our perspective, we regard rats as the unofficial mascots of New
York City, a testament to their profound significance and historical
presence in this iconic metropolis. When one conjures images of New York
City, the mental tableau invariably includes Times Square, the Statue of
Liberty, and, of course, the indomitable Rats! Since our arrival in the
city, we have been captivated by the sheer abundance of these resilient
creatures navigating our neighborhoods, particularly the astonishingly
large specimens that traverse the urban landscape. Identified as brown
rats, these New York City residents are renowned for their assertive and
often aggressive behavior.</p>
<p>Notably, the city’s rat population achieved global notoriety with the
infamous pizza rat incident, wherein a rat valiantly carried a slice of
pizza up a subway stairway. This incident serves as a vivid illustration
of the uniqueness of New York City rats, setting them apart from their
counterparts elsewhere. It’s not merely a matter of size; it’s a
distinct species that has adapted to the urban environment in a way
unparalleled by any other.</p>
<p>However, beyond their quirky fame, we acknowledge the serious
concerns associated with these rodents. New York City rats are potential
carriers of various harmful diseases that can significantly impact human
well-being. Their presence poses a threat to our food supply and living
spaces, potentially contributing to or exacerbating chronic diseases
such as asthma. The range of diseases they may carry is alarming,
including bacteria responsible for food poisoning (Salmonella and E.
coli) and pathogens causing severe, sometimes fatal fevers and
viruses.</p>
<p>Additionally, rats are vectors for fleas, lice, and mites,
introducing a host of serious diseases to humans. Increased exposure to
rodent hair, droppings, and urine heightens the risk of allergies and
asthma. Disease transmission occurs when humans or their pets come into
contact with rat saliva, urine, or feces. Furthermore, the structural
integrity of our buildings is jeopardized by the rats’ gnawing and
burrowing activities.</p>
<p>While these pint-sized celebrities have gained recognition in New
York and beyond, it remains paramount to manage their population
effectively, ensuring the safety and well-being of residents. Vigilant
control measures are necessary to mitigate the potential harm posed by
these fascinating yet potentially hazardous urban companions</p>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The goal of our dataset is to see where most of the right sightings
are within New York City and understand trends and patterns over time
and place. We know that the rat presence is significant within New York
City, and seeing where they like to hang out would be crucial
information for public health purposes. According to M&amp;M Pest
Control, rats in NYC are overpopulated – about three million rats
currently live within NYC and on average they are bigger compared to
other rats, ranging from 16 inches to 20 inches.</p>
<div id="preliminary-data-cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2>Preliminary data cleaning</h2>
<p>The data that we used was from NYC open data, which keeps track of
all the reported rat sightings. The dataset is constantly being updated
with new rat sightings added every day. The dataset we used contained
232,417 rows of data. We knew this would be too much data for the
purposes of our project, so we did some preliminary data cleaning.</p>
<p>First, we used the <code>janitor::clean()</code> function to reformat
the name of our columns. We then selected a portion of the original
columns to match our project goals. Since each of our observations had a
date value that stored the day, month, year, and time, we used
<code>separate</code> to divide this column into separate columns for
each of these variables. Our preliminary cleaned dataset include the
following variables:</p>
<p><code>unique key</code>: a unique identifier for each rat sighting
<code>month</code>: the numeric value of the month the rat sighting
occurred in <code>day</code>: the day of the month that the rat sighting
occurred on <code>year</code>: the year the rat sighting occurred in
<code>time</code>: the hour, minute and millisecond the rat sighting
occurred in <code>am_pm</code>: whether the time was in the AM or the PM
<code>location_type</code>: the type of location the rat sighting
occurred in <code>incident_zip</code>: the zip code the rat sighting
occurred in <code>city</code>: the “city” the rat sighting occurred in
<code>borough</code>: the borough the rat sighting occurred in
<code>latitude</code>: the latitude value for the rat sighting
<code>longitude</code>: the longitude value for the rat sighting
<code>location</code>: the combined latitude and longitude coordinates
for each rat sighting</p>

<p>The bar graph above illustrates the number of reported rat sightings
from April 2022 to November 2023. The red dashed line marks the
beginning of the Rat Czar’s term in April 2023.</p>
<p>A cursory glance at the graph suggests that there is variability in
the number of sightings reported each month, which may be influenced by
a variety of factors including seasonal changes and the urban
environment. While there is no immediate drastic reduction in sightings
following the appointment of the Rat Czar, this could imply that
strategies employed require time to take effect, or that their impact is
not instantly observable from this data alone.</p>

</div>
<div id="interpretation-of-the-graph" class="section level3">
<h3>Interpretation of the Graph</h3>
<p>The graph displays monthly rat sightings by borough in New York City
from April 2022 to November 2023. Each borough is represented by a
different color, with an additional category for unspecified locations.
A red dashed line denotes April 2023, when the Rat Czar commenced their
role.</p>
<p>Interpreting the graph, we can observe that sightings fluctuate
monthly, with peaks and troughs that may be influenced by various
factors, such as changes in weather or waste management practices. After
the red line, indicating the Rat Czar’s start date, there is no
immediate and drastic change in the trend of sightings for any borough.
This could suggest that any measures implemented by the Rat Czar may
take time to show significant effects.</p>
<p>Additionally, it’s noticeable that certain boroughs, such as Brooklyn
and Manhattan, consistently report higher numbers of sightings. The
graph also shows that some months exhibit a higher number of sightings
across all boroughs, which might indicate seasonal patterns in rat
activity or reporting.</p>
<p>Lastly, the unspecified category indicates reports that did not have
a borough listed. The presence of this category suggests that data
collection or reporting may have inconsistencies, which could affect the
analysis.</p>
<p>Overall, while the Rat Czar’s impact isn’t immediately discernible
from the graph, ongoing analysis with more data over time will be
essential to understand the full effect of the initiatives taken to
control the rat population.</p>

<h3>Interpretation of the Yearly Rat Sightings Graph</h3>
<p>The bar chart illustrates the trend in yearly rat sightings reported
in New York City from 2010 through 2023. There is a notable increase in
sightings in the year 2020, marked by a dashed pink line, which
coincides with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This rise suggests a
potential impact of the pandemic on rat sighting occurrences, possibly
due to changes in human activity patterns and urban waste dynamics
during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Subsequent years, 2021 and 2022, maintain a higher level of sightings
compared to the pre-pandemic years, indicating that the factors
contributing to increased sightings may have persisted beyond the
initial pandemic phase. The data for 2023 shows a continued prevalence
of rat sightings, suggesting that the conditions favorable to rat
visibility or population growth are still present.</p>
<p>However, without further analysis, we cannot conclusively attribute
changes in rat sighting trends solely to the pandemic. Other
environmental, social, or data collection factors might also play a
role. Ongoing monitoring and analysis would be necessary to understand
the full range of influences on rat sightings in New York City.</p>

<h3>Interpretation of the Average Daily Rat Sightings Graph</h3>
<p>The graph shows a comparison of average daily rat sightings in New
York City across three periods: before the COVID-19 pandemic
(Pre-COVID), during the pandemic (During-COVID), and after the
pandemic’s prevalence (Post-COVID). The “During-COVID” period exhibits
the highest average daily sightings, depicted by the red bar, which
could reflect the disruption of human activities and waste patterns
during the pandemic, potentially leading to increased rat visibility or
population changes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the “Post-COVID” period, represented by the green bar,
shows a continuation of higher average sightings compared to the
“Pre-COVID” period (blue bar). This suggests that the conditions leading
to increased sightings during the pandemic may have persisted or that
the rat population has been lastingly impacted by the pandemic’s
effects.</p>
<p>The data indicates that the pandemic may have had a significant and
enduring impact on rat sighting dynamics in the city, warranting further

<h3>Interpretation of the Average Daily Rat Sightings by Borough</h3>
<p>The bar chart compares average daily rat sightings in New York City
by borough, across three different periods: Pre-COVID, During-COVID, and
Post-COVID. Each borough is distinctly colored, allowing for an easy
visual comparison.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>During-COVID</strong>: Brooklyn shows the highest average
daily rat sightings among all boroughs, indicating that this borough may
have experienced the greatest impact from pandemic-related changes.
These changes could include disruptions in waste management and
alterations in human activity that could affect rat behavior.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Post-COVID</strong>: While there is a general decrease in
sightings in the Post-COVID period compared to During-COVID, the number
of sightings remains higher than in the Pre-COVID period. This suggests
that some of the factors affecting rat sightings during the pandemic may
continue to influence these numbers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pre-COVID</strong>: This period serves as a baseline,
showing the average daily sightings before the pandemic began. All
boroughs have relatively lower sightings compared to During-COVID,
